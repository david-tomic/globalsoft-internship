`globalsoft` web dev 101

The general idea is to go through the most used technologies/concepts, and leave out niche / advanced topics, while providing useful links for those who wish to know more.

Goal is to provide a window into a modern web development world, starting with seting up proper fundamentals for native web technologies - HTML, CSS and JS, walking down the history lane to see why the need for frameworks was born and what they help us achieve. We'll try to break down modern web landspace, various tools and technologies that web developers use for easier collaboration, faster development time and overall better developer / business experience.

First part will focus on frontend web dev basics mainly html, css, js native.

Even tho modern web frameworks are all the rage in nowadays learning world, starting with React or any other framework is counter intuitive as they build on these fundamentals heavily.

After that we'll go through some of tools that ease collaboration like git, tips and tricks to solve most common pain points.

We'll touch upon prettier, and eslint, and delve a bit into browser dev tools and useful ide extensions.

The frontend folder structure will consist of

```
/frontend
├── html/
├── css/
├── js/
/exercises - (examples/mini projects to supplement learning as we go over different topics)
```

For any questions / suggestions feel free to contact David any time and I'll get back to you whenever I catch some free time.
